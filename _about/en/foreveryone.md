## Our Audience
<br>
Uporter will be launched in different countries adjusted to the local media needs and languages spoken. Thus, generic and global Uporter’s umbrella will cover a vast amount of smaller entities based in countries across the world. 

Ultimately, we see our users as citizens of the world without any strict segmentation. However, we focus on people that make use of internet access and prefer reading latest daily news online. In a nutshell, it would be people of 14+ years of age that are considerably internet savvy. For instance, in Germany alone we are talking to the group of 25 million (31% of population) who read news mostly online (de.statista.com).

To portray a better picture of daily app consumption, we would like to mention a couple of case simulations emphasizing its’ simplicity and relevance: 

Case #1: You just have observed a basketball match and your favorite team won. World must definitely learn key milestones of the game and performance indicators of the players via the Sports category on Uporter.

Case #2: You just have boarded an airplane with one of the Swiss Councilors. It is obviously your time to shine by sharing pieces of your international affairs discussion from the flight under Politics category. 

Case #3: You are launching your great startup and moving to the Silicon Valley. Brag about it and let society know how you will change the world. 

Case #4: You have received an invitation to visit Paris fashion week. Share pictures of the catwalk with the rest of fashionistas in your country.
