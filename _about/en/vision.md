## Vision

We believe that every human being must have a free access to information and information must reach people as soon as it starts to exist. We believe that diversity of information enriches daily life of people and fosters their curiosity. We essentially believe that everyone has the right to share their instantaneous knowledge with the rest of the world and this shared knowledge of many would make the world more transparent and responsible medium to co-exist.
