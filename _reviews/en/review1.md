“I love this idea because when reading news I am always interested in what other readers think about published article. Uporter perfectly allows everyone not only to get involved into the discussion but also create own content. My favorite part about it is that while Uporter aims to be a global platform it allows people of small countries to write and read news in their own languages!”
